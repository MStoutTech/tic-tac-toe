## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was a group project to implement OOP in javascript. It started with analyzing a team leader's completed project and then starting from scratch, seeing how much we could figure out on our own before meeting again and working out final game logic, and then finally, putting on any of our own finishing touches.


## Optimizations

To build out the game more, the end of the game should be more exciting. I would add more colors or an animation. Then a tracker for game wins for each player and also to highlight who's turn it is.
There could also be an element of customization to allow players to enter their names or choose their symbol -perhaps an emoji to make it more fun.
Then maybe the board could expand at the end of the game to morph into a Connect 4 board, and when that game ends, it expands again to be an othello board.

## Lessons Learned:

As a first group project, it was open-ended on how we would solve it. This provided an extra challenge on how to meet and share screens. Replit works well for 2 people coding in tandem, but requires a paid plan for more contributers. Codepen allowed access to more, but we could not all work on the project at the same time.
This is also a different dynamic than to have multiple people working on different tasks in the same repository, but it was great experience to figure out building steps as a team.
Additionally, as a first project to implement OOP in javascript, it was really difficult to wrap my mind around what could be objects and then remember to use "this dot notation" when writing functions.
